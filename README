This is an updated version of the distributed-search twitter/searchbird project 
created by the twitter/scala-bootstrapper project. It is a thrift-based Finagle 
service that compiles a thrift source file into Ruby, Java, and Scala codes.

The requirements for building should be 
    - sbt 0.7.x (been tested with 0.7.4)
    - ruby/rubygem (for 'bundle install')

This project uses updated jars/plugins for Finagle, standard-project, and sbt-thrift, among others.

Scrooge, a thrift/scala compiler has been added to project.  It uses different syntax for 
the Finagle Client/Services; the changes are demonstrated in Client.scala. 

More changes to come...
